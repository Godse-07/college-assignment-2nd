//Multiple inheritance does not support in java â€“ justify. 


Multiple inheritance does not support in Java because it can lead to several complications like ambiguity (when a class inherits from multiple classes that have methods with the same name) and diamond problem (when a class inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor). To avoid these issues and keep the language simple and manageable, Java supports single inheritance for classes, meaning a class can only inherit from one superclass.
